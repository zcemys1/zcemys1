# Hello there, I’m Yaren! 👋

I’m a Biomedical Engineering graduate with hands-on experience in computational modelling,
data analysis, signal processing and building small web applications.

Most of my work focuses on applying engineering and data-driven methods to real-world
problems in healthcare and public policy.
